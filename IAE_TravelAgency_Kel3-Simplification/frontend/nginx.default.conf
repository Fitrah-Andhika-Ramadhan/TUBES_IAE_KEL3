  # Optional: Proxy API requests if your frontend makes direct calls
  # that need to be routed through Nginx to the API gateway.
  # However, the current frontend package.json uses a "proxy" field
  # for development, which isn't used by the production build directly.
  # API calls in production should use the full API gateway URL.
  # If you need Nginx to proxy /api calls, you'd add something like:
  # location /api {
  #   proxy_pass http://api-gateway-service-name:4000; # Docker service name
  #   proxy_set_header Host $host;
  #   proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  #   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  #   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  # }
}
